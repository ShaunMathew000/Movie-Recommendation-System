# Movie Recommendation System

## ðŸŒ¿ **Project Overview**  
A Movie Recommendation System leveraging deep learning and NLP techniques. The system is built upon the MovieLens 100k dataset, containing 100,000 ratings from 943 users across 1682 movies. The purpose of this system is to predict user preferences based on their past interactions (ratings) and recommend movies they are most likely to enjoy.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- Leverages a Transformer based model.
- Integrate user and movie embeddings.
- Utilize multi-head method.
- Design and train a deep-learning recommendation model using the MovieLens dataset.


## ðŸ’» Technical Methodology

### Model Architecture

This project employs a Transformer-based architecture that uses Artificial Intelligence concepts such as deep learning, representation learning, and attention mechanisms to provide a personalized movie recommendation experience. The application of AI-driven models enables this system to dynamically learn and adapt to users' evolving preferences, making it an ideal solution for personalized recommendations.

The model uses the concept of representation learning and positional encodings to handle the sequential order of interactions, allowing it to understand temporal relationships and evolving patterns in user preferences.

The ability of Transformer encoder layer to focus on relevant historical interactions enables the model to capture both long-term and short-term preferences effectively, creating a more comprehensive user profile. An attention pooling layer then refines the user's interaction history, summarizing key influences for each recommendation.

By combining collaborative filtering and content-based features within a deep learning framework, this architecture is capable of delivering accurate, personalized movie suggestions that continuously learn and improve.
